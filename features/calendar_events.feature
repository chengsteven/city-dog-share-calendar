Feature: Dog walkers can see dog information in the event details
As a dog walker
So that I can know which dogs I am walking during an appointment
I want to be able to see information about the dog(s) on the event
  
# Background:
#   Given the following users exist:
#   | last_name  | first_name | location              | gender | image                      | status  | phone_number  | email                           | description  | availability |

#   And I am signed in as "Bruce Wayne"
#   And an appointment called DogWalk exists today for user "Bruce Wayne"
#   And that I am on the calendar page


# Scenario: Seeing dog profile info

#   When I click on DogWalk
#   Then I should see "Dog Name"
